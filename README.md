This is actually a less serious weekend project called AT-Net which can be thought as a variation on Mobile-Net architecture. We start with a convolutional layer then use seperable convolutions. Finally use some encoder type transformer layers. Together with some register tokens and a class token. The convolution part is highly motivated by "Patches are all you need paper". This dude is trained on ImageNet1k dataset, we offer three different sizes: XS, S, L. 
 <h1> Our motto in coming up with AT-Net:</h1>

 <ul>
  <li>We do something because we want do that thing!!!,</li>
  <li> No promise to get very high accuracy,</li>
  <li> We would like to hybridize things,</li>
  
</ul> 
Enjoy AT-Net!!!

# Training Details
# Optimizers
# Epochs - Batch Size


I have reached --- accuracy on ---, and guess this happened where, at home on two GPUs!!!
