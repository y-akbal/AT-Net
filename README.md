# AT-Net
This is actually a less serious weekend project called AT-Net which can be thought as a variaton on Mobile-Net architecture. We start with a convolutional layer then use seperable convolutions. Finally use some encoder type transformer layers. The convolution part is highly motivated by "Patches are all you need paper".
Enjoy AT-Net

I have reached --- accuracy on ---, and guess this happened where, at home on two GPUs!!!
